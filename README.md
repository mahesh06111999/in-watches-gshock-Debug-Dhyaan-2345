## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and content for the web page.
- **CSS**: Handles the UI and styling, ensuring an appealing visual presentation.
- **Sass**: Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It adds features like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, making CSS more maintainable and efficient.

### Design Elements

1. **Media Queries:**
   Media queries are utilized to ensure the website's responsiveness across various screen sizes. By adjusting the layout and styling dynamically, the website offers an optimal viewing experience on different devices.

2. **Keyframes:**
   Keyframes are employed to create captivating animations within the website. By defining specific animation steps, keyframes enhance user engagement and interaction, providing a seamless browsing experience.

3. **Overlay:**
   The overlay feature is integrated to enhance the visual presentation of images. By adding a translucent layer over images, overlay improves readability and focus, making text content more prominent and appealing.
4. **Responsive Design:**
   Utilizes media queries and flex layouts to adapt the page layout across various devices, ensuring a seamless browsing experience on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

5. **Fonts & Icons:**
   Integrates Google Fonts and FontAwesome icons for enhanced typography and visual elements. By leveraging these resources, the website achieves a modern and visually appealing design, improving readability and user engagement.
